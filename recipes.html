            <h2>Indian chickpeas with poached eggs</h2>

      <p> <em>   1 tbsp rapeseed oil
<br>2 garlic cloves, chopped
<br>1 yellow pepper, deseeded and diced
<br>½ - 1 red chilli, deseeded and chopped
<br>½ bunch spring onions
 (about 5), tops and whites sliced but kept separate
<br>1 tsp cumin
, plus a little extra to serve (optional)
<br>1 tsp coriander
<br>½ tsp turmeric
<br>3 tomatoes
, cut into wedges
<br>⅓ pack coriander, chopped
<br>400g can chickpeas in water, drained but liquid reserved
<br>½ tsp reduced-salt bouillon powder (we used Marigold)
<br>4 large eggs</em>
     <br><br> Heat the oil in a non-stick sauté pan, add the garlic, pepper, chilli and the whites from the spring onions, and fry for 5 mins over a medium-high heat. Meanwhile, put a large pan of water on to boil.<br> <br> Once the water is at a rolling boil, crack in your eggs and poach for 2 mins, then remove with a slotted spoon. Stir the spring onion tops into the chickpeas, then very lightly crush a few of the chickpeas with a fork or potato masher. Spoon the chickpea mixture onto plates, scatter with the reserved coriander and top with the eggs. Serve with an extra sprinkle of cumin, if you like.
